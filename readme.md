### The Problem We're trying to solve
When working with Legacy code one of the main problems is we do not have tests. To start refactoring code we better have tests to let us do it with calm.
Whilte integration tests are good, unit tests are much better. Integration tests take a long time and a complicated environment (if that's not the case for you - use the integration tests). Unit tests are fast and do not need any special environment. When we code we run our unit tests every 2-3 minutes if not more, and it takes them under a second to complete.
Writing unit tests for legcy code isn't easy. One of the problems is that the code is usually entangled in many other pieces of code, which makes harnessing it inot a unit tests very difficult.
The problem we're trying to solve here is to help harnessing legacy code into a unit test.

### Runtime Spies - Javascript
The Runtime Spies are pieces of code you add to your code (on a side branch - this doesn't go into production) which capture traffic going into and out of the code you want to test (is it one function? A set of function? That's for you to decide).
After adding the code you run scenarios in the integration environenment. The Runtime spies capture the traffic and produce a harness for the unit test.

Then you should start refactoring.

### example (see explanation below)
This is one unit test from the project. You need to require RuntimeSpy.js for it to work.

```js
    mocha.it('Mocks', function () {

        //here are definitions of global functions and variables used in our function: 'testFunction'
        var helper1 = function (x) {

            globalVar = 2 * x
            return 2 * x
        }
        var helper2 = function (x) { return 3 * x }
        var globalVar = 5
        var globalVar2 = { 1: 6, 2: 2 }
        var b = { 1: 1, 2: globalVar2 }
        globalVar2['3'] = b

        var harness = ''
        //testFunction is the function we want to generate unit test harness for
        var testFunction = function (A) {
            // We've added the following lines to generate the harness
            var mySpy = new RuntimeSpy('mySpy') //the main spy object
            mySpy.setStartFunctionCall(arguments, 'testFunction') //capturing the function's arguments
            eval(mySpy.addVariableSpies('globalVar', 'globalVar2').getCodeToEvalToSpyOnVariables()) //spying on global variables
            eval(mySpy.addFunctionSpies('helper1', 'helper2').getCodeToEvalToSpyOnFunctions()) //spying on global functions
            //end of setup
            helper1(21) //first line of the function
            var result = helper1(A) + helper2(A) + globalVar + globalVar2['3']['2']['1'] //second line
            mySpy.addFinalResult(result) //here I tell the spy what is the end result so it can later assert on it
            harness = mySpy.getHarness() //generating the harness

            return result //third line
        }



        expect(testFunction(5)).equals(41) //This is the first run of the function, in which we generate the harness
        //The next three lines are just here to show that even though we're changing the global functioins/variables, the results with the harness will be the same
        helper1 = function (x) { return 2 }
        helper2 = function (x) { return 2 }
        globalVar = 8
        
        eval(harness) // This is the actual test run. Here we run the function with the harness. See the next section for the harness
    })
```
### The Harness
The harness generated by the above code (harness variable) is the below. You need to require Harness.js and VariableLiteral.js for it to work.
```js
        var myHarness = new Harness('myHarness')
        var mockRepositoryData = {}
        mockRepositoryData['helper1'] = {input:[[21],[5]],output:[42,10]}
        mockRepositoryData['helper2'] = {input:[[5]],output:[15]}
        myHarness.setMockRepositoryData(mockRepositoryData)
        myHarness.addFunctionMock('helper1')
        helper1= function(){
        return myHarness.callFunctionSpy('helper1',arguments,function(codeToEval){eval(codeToEval)})
        }
        myHarness.addFunctionMock('helper2')
        helper2= function(){
        return myHarness.callFunctionSpy('helper2',arguments,function(codeToEval){eval(codeToEval)})
        }
        globalVar_DB = new Map([['Initial','globalVar = 5'],['helper1_0','globalVar = 42'],['helper1_1','globalVar = 10']])
        var globalVar

        myHarness.addGlobalVariableMock('globalVar',globalVar_DB)
        globalVar2_DB = new Map([['Initial','globalVar2 = {1:6,2:2,3:{1:1}};globalVar2[\'3\'][\'2\']=globalVar2'],['helper1_0','globalVar2 = {1:6,2:2,3:{1:1}};globalVar2[\'3\'][\'2\']=globalVar2'],['helper1_1','globalVar2 = {1:6,2:2,3:{1:1}};globalVar2[\'3\'][\'2\']=globalVar2'],['helper2_0','globalVar2 = {1:6,2:2,3:{1:1}};globalVar2[\'3\'][\'2\']=globalVar2']])
        var globalVar2

        myHarness.addGlobalVariableMock('globalVar2',globalVar2_DB)
        myHarness.updateVariablesByTag('Initial',function(codeToEval){eval(codeToEval)})
        testFunctionParam0 = 5
        expect(VariableLiteral.getVariableLiteral(testFunction(testFunctionParam0)
        ).getLiteralAndCyclicDefinition('result')).equals('result = 41')
```

Good luck :-)
